## Introduction

The AI/ML Tennis Analysis System is designed to analyze tennis matches using advanced computer vision techniques. Leveraging the power of YOLO (You Only Look Once) for real-time object detection, PyTorch for building neural networks, and key point extraction methods, this system aims to provide in-depth analysis of player movements, ball trajectories, and match statistics.

## Project Overview

Tennis is a dynamic sport where real-time analysis can significantly enhance player performance and coaching strategies. This project focuses on creating a system that analyzes matches by detecting players, the ball, and their interactions, offering valuable insights through visual data representation and statistical analysis.

## Key Features

- **Real-time Object Detection:** Utilizes YOLO for detecting players and the ball during live matches.
- **Player Movement Analysis:** Tracks player movements and positions using key point extraction techniques.
- **Statistics Generation:** Generates comprehensive statistics on player performance, including shot accuracy and movement patterns.
- **Visualization:** Provides visual representations of player trajectories, shot placements, and other relevant metrics.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Allows coaches and players to access analytics easily and understand match dynamics.

## Novelty and Uniqueness

This project stands out due to its integration of multiple advanced technologies, providing a comprehensive analysis of tennis matches. Key novel aspects include:

- **Real-Time Performance:** The system analyzes matches in real-time, enabling immediate feedback for players and coaches.
- **Hybrid Analysis Approach:** Combines object detection and key point extraction to offer detailed insights into player movements and ball dynamics.
- **User-Centric Design:** The web interface is designed for ease of use, allowing users to focus on analysis without needing deep technical knowledge.

## Technologies Used

- **YOLO:** Real-time object detection framework for identifying players and the ball.
- **PyTorch:** A deep learning library used for building and training neural networks.
- **OpenCV:** For image processing and video analysis.
- **Matplotlib:** For data visualization and graphical representation of analysis results.
- **Flask:** For creating a web-based interface to interact with the system.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   - `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/tennis-analysis-system.git`
   - `cd tennis-analysis-system`

2. Install required packages:
   - `pip install -r requirements.txt`

3. Download YOLO weights and configuration files and place them in the `weights` directory.

## Usage

1. Prepare your video file or connect to a camera for real-time analysis.
2. Run the application:
   - `python main.py`

3. Access the web interface at `http://localhost:5000` to view analysis results.

## Data Collection

The dataset used for training the model consists of various tennis match videos collected from publicly available sources. The data includes annotations for player positions and ball locations, enabling effective training of the detection and analysis models.

## Model Training

1. **Data Preparation:** Preprocess the video frames for object detection and key point extraction.
2. **Model Configuration:** Configure the YOLO model parameters and define the architecture in PyTorch.
3. **Training:** Train the model using the annotated dataset to improve detection accuracy.
4. **Evaluation:** Validate the model's performance using metrics like precision, recall, and mAP (mean Average Precision).

## Results

The AI/ML Tennis Analysis System demonstrated impressive performance in real-time object detection and player movement analysis. The results include:

- Detection accuracy of over 90% for players and the ball.
- Detailed movement analysis with graphical outputs showcasing player trajectories.
- Statistical insights on shot performance and match dynamics.

## Future Work
